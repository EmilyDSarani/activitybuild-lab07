I just need a space where I can think through this app.

Lab Guidelines:
Create all CRUD routes for at least one model. Use the red, green, refactor process.

You should have some interaction to put in your service. Some examples:

send an email with Amazon SES
fetch from a web API to fill in data
save a file to Amazon S3
use the tensorflow toxicity model to reject toxic text

CRUD routes-
POST
GET
GETID
PUT 
DELETE

Was going to do a third part API, but decided to try the Amazon SES...mostly because idk what it is. 
https://aws.amazon.com/ses/
--this requires your CC account, idk if I am comfortable with that
--might look into another thing
https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/toxicity
--This would be cool for future reference. Sus out toxic messages for websites. 
--not exactly sure how to use this, but I will forsure ask.

--I could create a user and have them sign in 
--get a random activity
